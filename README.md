# Film Festival Scheduling Plugin - WIP. Not ready for use yet. #
WP Plugin that generates a snazzy film screening CPT that is auto-ordered as a schedule grid on your site. Each film in the grid is clickable, and has its own page with additional details, including trailers, photos, etc.  As seen on northwestfest.ca and rainbowvisions.ca.
